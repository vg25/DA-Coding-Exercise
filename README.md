1. The ER. pdf file contanis the diagram for new structured relational data model.
2. Then, the sql-query.sql file contains the mysql query that directly answers predetermined question. 
3. I then used python to do EDA on the three json files - receipts, brands, and users. 
4. The data issues - fetch data file contains the email I have written to the manager to communicate the findings.

Additional: In Receipts_tosql, I converted the json file to a dataframe and loaded it into a relational table.
